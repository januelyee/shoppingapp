    <li>Converting a selection to list block items when there are new lines in between inserts unwanted bullets</li>
    <li>The "loaded" event was incorrectly firing when the user switched to fullscreen or back, in addition to on load
    </li>
    <li>Changing the font size on a misspelled word would sometimes result in a partial underline</li>

</ul>
<h2>Textbox.io 1.0.0.1443</h2>

<h3>Please Note</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Mobile support is limited to iOS 7. Android devices will be supported in a future release.</li>
    <li>Image insertion operations may move the current cursor and/or selection location.</li>
    <li>On iOS occasionally the virtual keyboard can become out of synchronization with the editor (i.e. it is displayed
        or hidden when it shouldn't be). Returning focus to the editor by touching in the editable region usually
        corrects this issue.
    </li>
    <li>Due to an Internet Explorer 10 rendering issue, new paragraphs may appear as two lines instead of a single line
        on this browser.
    </li>
    <li>On Internet Explorer 11 spelling highlights can occasionally cause the current selection to change.</li>
    <li>Some character combinations within a URL may cause the generated link to be invalid or incomplete.</li>
    <li>Microsoft Word documents with large numbers of images may cause a "#1502" memory error in Adobe Flash indicating
        that he image paste operation has failed due to memory constraints.
    </li>
    <li>Image upload is currently only supported for images smaller than 4.5MB.</li>
</ul>
